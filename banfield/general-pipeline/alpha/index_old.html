with the goal of doing the right thing for pets. That’s why I wanted to be a vet in the first place. I’ve been
here 8 years now. Started as a new grad and now I’m chief of staff. There’s no way I could have done
that without these folks at Banfield. What do I like most about my role? I’d have to say the chance to
build bonds with clients. It’s partnership. When we can work together, we can keep their pets healthy."</p>

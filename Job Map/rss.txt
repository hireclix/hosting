At Mohawk there are always opportunities for high performing professionals to excel! Are you the best? If so show us what you are made of and come build your career with us!
  
**Responsibilities**
  
**ARE YOU READY TO APPLY YOUR SKILLS AND TALENTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE?**
  
Mohawk Industries has a tremendous opportunity for a creative professional on the company’s award-winning corporate communications team. (We win awards because we have great people; we need one more great person!)
  
**DON’T KNOW MOHAWK?**
  
If you want to see our official story, check us out at https://www.mohawkind.com or look at what’s currently happening in the company at http://www.mymohawk.com . We’re a BIG company. In fact, we’re the world’s largest floor covering manufacturer and a Fortune 500 corporation. We’re stable, successful and growing. We’re also a fun, informal company. We take our jobs seriously, but you’ll still hear laughter and occasionally off-key singing while people work together and learn from one another. Mostly importantly, Mohawk provides a place where you can be you. Individuality is celebrated here! It’s a company where talent is appreciated and where you can truly make a difference!
  
**WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THIS JOB?**
  
You’ll handle all aspects of Mohawk’s U.S. employee-oriented social media, starting with Facebook and setting a course from there. Want to explore other platforms and geographies? Let’s grow that plan together. You’ll be part of developing the social media strategy, not just executing the day-to-day tasks. You will help connect employees, potential employees and the communities where we do business so everyone knows what’s going on at our facilities – lots of good stuff – and so that people have a place where they can express themselves.
  
We are also assessing a new mobility platform used primarily for emergency or urgent communications so that employees receive essential information they need when they need it. You’ll help to define this channel from the start and guide it through implementation.
  
We are developing ways to make mass e-mail messages more vibrant and meaningful. (Translation: we want people to read the messages they receive.) You’ll play a key role in making a traditional business channel fresh and useful.
  
(We have a lot more detail; but this can all be discussed face to face so you can share your ideas, too!)
  
**Qualifications**
  
We think people are more than a bullet point list of qualifications. We appreciate that earning a degree shows commitment and provides a good start to a career. We respect previous experience, because it establishes a foundation for future success. We’re not hung up on how many years you’ve done great work. There’s no magic number. If you know how to tell stories and build audiences on Facebook, please apply now! We have a lot to discuss.
  
**WHAT MAKES THIS JOB A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU?**
  
If you have exceptional writing and editing skills, this role can help you make those skills even stronger. You’ll work with people who love to collaborate, share ideas and provide meaningful feedback and encouragement. We all want to do better, learn more and be proud of what we do. Mohawk offers a lot of learning opportunities, good mentors who like to see people succeed, peer support and many special project opportunities. Want a graduate degree? We can help with that after you’re here for a year.
